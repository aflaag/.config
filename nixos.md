# nixos

## To fix

### general

- understand what should go into home-manager
- really understand what the heck flakes are

- change the configuration.nix path, it's super annoying
- make another repository for nixos configuration folder and new .config folder

### zsh

- it's super slow, maybe this https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/issues/108

### autocpu-freq

- doesn't start on its own, need to nixos-rebuild to actually start it
    - check with autocpu-freq --stats

### python

- make the packages work
    - so far pip gets installed correctly and packages work inside environments
